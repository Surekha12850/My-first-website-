    <h2>Test Driven Development</h2>
    <p>tests before writing the actual code, focusing on an iterative cycle of writing tests, seeing them fail, implementing code to pass the tests, and then refactoring.</p>
    <h3>The TDD Cycle</h3>
    <p> TDD follows a simple, iterative process known as the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:<br>
 <b>Red: </b>Write a failing test for a specific functionality. <br>
<b>Green: </b>Write the minimum code required to make the test pass. <br>
<b>Refactor: </b>Improve the code's design while ensuring all tests still pass. This cycle is repeated for each new feature or functionality</p>

<p> <b>Example of TDD: </b>A simple TDD example for a function that adds two numbers. <br>
Step 1: Write a Failing Test (Red) 
Start by writing a test for the sum method. Since the Calculator class doesn't exist yet, this test will fail when we run it.<br>

 <b>CalculatorTest.java:</b><br>
public class CalculatorTest<br>
{<br>
public static void main(String args[])<br>
    { int x=10,y=2;<br>
        Calculator c=new<br> Calculator();<br>
if( c.sum (10,2)==12)<br>
{<br>
            System.out.println("test ok");<br>
}<br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
Error<br>
At this point, if you run the test, it will fail because the Calculator class and its sum method do not exist.<br>
<b>Step 2: </b>Write the Code to Make the Test Pass (Green) 
Next, implement the Calculator class with an sum method. The goal is to write just enough code to make the test pass. <br>
<b>Calculator.java:</b><br>
public class Calculator<br>
{<br>
    public int sum(int x,int y)<br
{<br>
return x+y; }<br>
<b>Output:</b> test ok<br>
Now, if you run the test, it should pass because the sum method correctly adds the two numbers.<br>
<b>Step 1.1: Write a Failing Test (Red)</b> 
Start by writing a test for the subtract method. Since the Calculator class doesn't exist yet, this test will fail when we run it.<br>
<b>CalculatorTest.java:</b><br>
 if( c.subtract(10,2)==8)<br>
        {<br>
System.out.println("test ok");<br>
}<br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
Error<br>
At this point, if you run the test, it will fail because the Calculator class and its  subtract method do not exist.<br>
<b>Step 2.2: Write the Code to Make the Test Pass (Green) </b>
Next, implement the Calculator class with an subtract method. The goal is to write just enough code to make the test pass. <br>
<b>Calculator.java:</b><br>
public class Calculator<br>
{<br>
    public int subtract (int x,int y)<br>
{<br>
return x-y; }<br>
<b>Output: </b><br>
test ok<br>
Now, if you run the test, it should pass because the subtract method correctly subtracts the two numbers.<br>
<b>Step 3: Refactor</b><br>
Refactor the code to improve its design. For example, you might add input validation or optimize the logic. Ensure the test still passes after refactoring
